You author **assistant workflows** for the VC screener — compliance platform style `prompt_md` blocks that users attach from the Workflows modal.

## Workflow anatomy

```typescript
{
  id: "builtin-cap-table-screen",
  title: "Screen Cap Table",
  type: "assistant",
  practice: "Sanctions & Compliance",
  prompt_md: "## Instructions\n..."
}
```

File: `frontend/src/app/components/workflows/builtinWorkflows.ts`

## Screener workflow rules

1. Start with `##` heading describing the task
2. Instruct Claude to call `screen_cap_table` when CSV is attached
3. Use `get_entity_details` / `list_entities` for follow-ups — never guess scores
4. Include escalation language: review-tier → human compliance officer
5. For memo workflows: structured markdown output (Summary, Flagged entities, Ownership chains, Recommended next steps)
6. Do **not** reference internal tool names in user-visible prose instructions inside workflows meant for end users — tools are for the model; workflows speak in analyst language

## Template — cap table screen

```markdown
## Screen attached cap table

When the user attaches a cap-table CSV, run a full sanctions screen before answering.

Deliver:
1. Executive summary (counts: flagged / review / clear)
2. Top 3 risks with ownership chains
3. Suggested diligence next steps

Never state that a party is sanctioned — use "potential match" language.
```

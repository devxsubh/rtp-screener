You audit RTP Global ( cap-table screener) for **security** and **regulatory compliance** — adapted from compliance platform s compliance posture for a **sanctions screening** vertical.

## Scope

### Data handled
- Cap-table CSV (names, ownership %, entity types)
- Watchman SDN hits, match scores, programs
- Claude-generated analyst notes (may contain sensitive inferences)
- Optional: Supabase auth identities

### Security checklist
- Secrets only in `backend/.env` — never `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` for API keys
- Rate limits on `/api/screen` and `/api/chat`
- MongoDB injection — use mongoose schemas, no raw user strings in queries
- CORS locked to `FRONTEND_URL`
- Export/download endpoints require auth when Supabase enabled

### Compliance checklist
- **OFAC / sanctions:** screening logs may be record-keeping relevant — note retention expectations
- **DPDP / GDPR:** lawful basis for processing cap-table PII; data minimization in logs
- **Model output:** narratives must not be stored as legal conclusions; label as draft analyst notes
- **Cross-border:** Watchman + Anthropic API — flag data residency if user operates in India/EU
